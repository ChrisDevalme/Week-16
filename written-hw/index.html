        <span>What is Express in Node.js and why is it used?
</span>
        <span class="ans">Express is a node js web application framework that provides broad features for building web and mobile applications. It is used to build a single page, multipage, and hybrid web application. </span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>How does Mongoose help in using MongoDB with Node.js?
</span>
        <span class="ans">Mongoose is Object Data Modeling (ODM) for MongoDB. It represents application data as JavaScript objects, mapped to the underlying MongoDB database. You can use Mongoose to model data, enforce schemas, validate models, and manipulate data in a database without familiarity with the underlying database semantics.</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Can you explain the role of Mongoose in managing relationships between data?</span>
        <span class="ans">Mongoose referencing is a mechanism that lets us create relationships between different data models in MongoDB. It's similar to how we would create relationships using foreign keys in relational databases.</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>What is a software design pattern? Give an example.
</span>
        <span class="ans">A software design pattern is a general reusable solution to a common problem that occurs in software design. It represents a best practice or a template for solving a particular problem in a way that is both efficient and effective. MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a pattern in software design commonly used to implement user interfaces, data, and controlling logic. It emphasizes a separation between the software's business logic and display. This "separation of concerns" provides for a better division of labor and improved maintenance. </span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Can you explain the MVC architecture in detail?
</span>
        <span class="ans">MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a pattern in software design commonly used to implement user interfaces, data, and controlling logic. It emphasizes a separation between the software's business logic and display. This "separation of concerns" provides for a better division of labor and improved maintenance.</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>What roles do Model, View, and Controller play in the MVC architecture?</span>
        <span class="ans">The model is responsible for managing the data of the application. It receives user input from the controller. The view renders presentation of the model in a particular format. The controller responds to the user input and performs interactions on the data model objects.</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Define Latency and Throughput in the context of APIs.
</span>
        <span class="ans">It shows the time that data takes to transfer across the network. Networks with a longer delay or lag have high latency, while those with fast response times have lower latency. In contrast, throughput refers to the average volume of data that can actually pass through the network over a specific time.</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Why is it important to minimize latency and maximize throughput in APIs?</span>
        <span class="ans">API latency refers to the delay or lag in the response time of an API (Application Programming Interface). High API latency can slow down mobile app performance, leading to user frustration and poor user experience, while low latency ensures faster and more responsive apps.</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>What is Authentication in terms of web development?</span>
        <span class="ans">Authentication is used by a server when the server needs to know exactly who is accessing their information or site. Authentication is used by a client when the client needs to know that the server is system it claims to be. In authentication, the user or computer has to prove its identity to the server or client.</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>How does the authorization process start?</span>
        <span class="ans">A straightforward process, user authentication consists of three tasks: Identification - Users have to prove who they are. Authentication - Users have to prove they are who they say they are. Authorization - Users have to prove they're allowed to do what they are trying to do.</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>What is express.static used for in Express?</span>
        <span class="ans">A built-in middleware function is provided by Express called express. static that allows you to serve static files from a directory. This middleware function takes one argument, which is the name of the directory where your static files are stored.</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Can you give an example of serving static files using express.static?
</span>
        <span class="ans">To serve static files such as images, CSS files, and JavaScript files, use the express.static built-in middleware function in Express. The function signature is: express.static(root, [options])</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>What is Jest and why is it used?</span>
        <span class="ans">Jest is a JavaScript testing framework designed to ensure correctness of any JavaScript codebase. It allows you to write tests with an approachable, familiar and feature-rich API that gives you results quickly. Jest is well-documented, requires little configuration and can be extended to match your requirements.</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>How can Supertest be helpful when working with Jest?</span>
        <span class="ans">Jest is a framework for testing JavaScript code. Unit testing is the main usage of it. SuperTest: Using Supertest, we can test endpoints and routes on HTTP servers. since we are continuing to use the setups from previous parts of the series we are going to implement the test on the product REST API.</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Can you describe how manual and automated tests are executed?</span>
        <span class="ans">In manual testing, a human performs the tests step by step, without test scripts. In automated testing, tests are executed automatically via test automation frameworks, along with other tools and software. That means automated testing is faster than manual testing.</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>What is the difference between unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing?</span>
        <span class="ans">End-to-end testing helps to identify defects that may not be found in unit or integration testing. Integration testing may only identify some defects, especially if the software system is complex. End-to-end testing can be time-consuming and expensive, especially for large and complex software systems.</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Can you provide examples of functional, regression, smoke, and performance tests? </span>
        <span class="ans">Functional Testing: Consider an e-commerce application. A functional test scenario could be to verify that the "Add to Cart" button correctly adds a selected item to the shopping cart, and the total reflects the addition. Regression Testing: After an e-commerce website adds a new feature, regression testing would involve checking previously tested features, such as ensuring that the login functionality still works correctly. Smoke Testing: For a web application, smoke testing might involve checking if the main page loads, user authentication works, and the basic navigation is functional after a new build is deployed. Performance Testing: In a performance test for a web application, you might simulate a large number of concurrent users accessing the site to assess how well it handles the load. This could involve measuring response times, throughput, and server resource utilization.
 </span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>What is meant by positive testing and negative testing in a functional testing context?</span>
        <span class="ans">The purpose of positive testing is to validate the expected, correct behavior of the system, while negative testing aims to uncover potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the software by testing how well it handles unexpected or incorrect inputs. Both types of testing are crucial for ensuring the overall reliability and robustness of the software application.</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>How does load testing assess the behavior of software?</span>
        <span class="ans">Load testing assesses the behavior of software by simulating realistic usage scenarios and subjecting the system to varying levels of load, representing different numbers of concurrent users or transactions. The primary goal of load testing is to evaluate how well the software performs under anticipated or peak loads and to identify potential performance bottlenecks. </span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>What aspects does usability testing assess in a software application?</span>
        <span class="ans">Usability testing assesses a software application's user-friendliness by evaluating aspects such as ease of use, efficiency, learnability, and error prevention. It aims to gauge user satisfaction, ensuring that the application is intuitive, visually appealing, and consistent in design. The evaluation also includes factors like memorability, accessibility, and how well the application handles errors. </span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Why is security testing crucial in a software development life cycle?</span>
        <span class="ans">Security testing is an integral part of the software development life cycle because it helps safeguard sensitive information, maintain user trust, meet regulatory requirements, prevent financial losses, mitigate reputation damage, ensure business continuity, adapt to evolving threats, secure against cyber attacks, and protect intellectual property. It is an essential component of building robust, reliable, and secure software systems.</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Can you explain what compatibility testing is?</span>
        <span class="ans">Compatibility testing is a type of software testing that ensures a software application functions correctly and as intended across different environments, platforms, browsers, devices, and operating systems. The goal of compatibility testing is to verify that the application provides a consistent and reliable user experience regardless of the variations in the computing environment. This type of testing is particularly important given the diversity of devices and configurations that users may employ.</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>What is the aim of recovery testing and why is it important?</span>
        <span class="ans">The aim of recovery testing is to assess how well a software application can recover from failures, disruptions, or unexpected events, and to evaluate the system's ability to resume normal operation after encountering such incidents. The primary goal is to ensure that the software can recover gracefully and maintain data integrity in the face of unexpected circumstances.</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>What is User Acceptance Testing (UAT) and who typically performs it?</span>
        <span class="ans">User Acceptance Testing (UAT) is the final phase of software testing, where end users evaluate the application to ensure it meets business requirements. Participants typically include end users, business stakeholders, and quality assurance teams. UAT focuses on real-world scenarios, user feedback, and the confirmation that the software is ready for production deployment. It plays a crucial role in gaining user confidence and validating the software's alignment with business objectives before its release.</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Can you describe a scenario in which you would use each of the different testing types mentioned in the notes?</span>
        <span class="ans">Functional Testing Scenario: Imagine you are developing an online banking application. In functional testing, you would verify that core functions such as account creation, fund transfers, balance inquiries, and bill payments work as expected. For instance, you would ensure that a user can successfully transfer money between accounts, and the transaction history accurately reflects the transfer. <br>
Regression Testing Scenario: After introducing a new feature in the online banking application, such as a mobile check deposit, regression testing becomes crucial. You would run regression tests to confirm that the addition of this new feature did not introduce issues with existing functionalities, ensuring that activities like account login and balance checks still function correctly.</span>
